<h2> ðŸŒ¾ FARMERS MARKET </h2>
The <a href="https://github.com/Ajaiqmar/FARMERS_MARKET">Farmers Market</a> ðŸŒ¾ Application is a Web application which was one of the earlier projects that I built. This application was built to increase the exposure of younger generation on Farming. My idea was to increase the Profitability of Farmers which ultimately will attract the younger generations into considering Farming as a profession. The way that I found to be helpful in increasing the profitability is Farmers Market but one of the biggest issue with the pre-existing model is that the geography, one has to travel a long distance to reach the nearby Farmers Market, So a solution that I thought was to build a e-commerce model based on this pre-existing idea. This was the result of this idea.
